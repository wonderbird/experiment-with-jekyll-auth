# Experiment with Jekyll Auth

Experiment with the [jekyll-auth module](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-auth).

The software in this project is highly experimental. Its only purpose is for me to learn about integrating authentication into a Jekyll site.

## TODO

* ✅ Create a minimal Jekyll site
* ✅ Create a free Heroku account
* ✅ Follow the [Getting Started](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-auth/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) instructions for the [jekyll-auth module](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-auth)
* Fix: Cannot open https://experiment-with-jekyll.herokuapp.com/ although I am member of the organisation - do I need to modify the `.env` file?
