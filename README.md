# Experiment with Jekyll Auth

Experiment with the [jekyll-auth module](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-auth).

The software in this project is highly experimental. Its only purpose is for me to learn about integrating authentication into a Jekyll site.

## TODO

* Create a minimal Jekyll site
* Setup authentication for the Jekyll site following the instructions for the [jekyll-auth module](https://github.com/benbalter/jekyll-auth)
